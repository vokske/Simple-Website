            Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning
            I sit around
            Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
            Strange voices are sayin' (what did they say?)
            Things I can't understand
            It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand
            
            It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer
            Leavin' me here on my own
            It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer
            Now you're gone
            
            The city is crowded, my friends are away
            And I'm on my own
            It's too hot to handle, so I got to get up and go
            
            It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer
            Leavin' me here on my own
            It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer
            Now you're gone
            Gonna feel only it was
            
            It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer
            (Leavin' me) leavin' me here on my own
            It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer
            Now you're gone
            
            It's a cruel, cruel summer
            Leaving me here on my own
            It's a cruel, cruel summer
            Now you're gone
            You're not the only one
            
            It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer
            (Leavin' me) leavin' me here on my own
            It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer
            Now you're gone
            You're not the only one
            
            It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer
            (Leavin' me) leavin' me here on my own
            It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer
            Now you're gone
            You're not the only one
            
            It's a cruel...
